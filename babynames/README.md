I'm still relatively new to Python. These steps may be obvious to others. I still find them useful.

1. Create a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) with `python -m venv .venv`.
2. Activate the virtual environment with `./.venv/Scripts/activate.ps1`.
3. Install packages with `pip install requirements.txt`.
