# Baby Names

Analysis of baby name trends in the US. For no particular reason.

# Setup

I'm still relatively new to Python. These steps may be obvious to others. I still find them useful.

1. Install Python 3.11
1. Create a Python [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) with `python -m venv .venv`.
1. Activate the virtual environment with `./.venv/Scripts/activate.ps1`.
1. Install packages with `pip install requirements.txt`.

# Packages

Here are the packages I have installed to make this notebook work:

- fuzzy
- jupyter
- matplotlib
- pandas
- requests

## Fuzzy

Phonetic string matching.

## Pandas

I'm very new to Pandas. It's neat. Work with tabular data sets. Like Excel but Python.
