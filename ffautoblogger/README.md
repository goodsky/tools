This tool will access a public ESPN league and scrape the teams and players for a given week.
The scraped data will be written into simple HTML that can be pasted into a blogger website.
Simple heuristics are used to find 'interesting' stats from a week to be written into the blog.

I am learning Python while writing this, so thanks to the following authors:
